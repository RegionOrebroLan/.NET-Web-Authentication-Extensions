# Deprecated decorators

This folder/namespace contains deprecated decorators. We need to start over with the decorators we have. We have put them in a separate folder to be reminded of it and not forget them.

For sure there will be deprecated decorators that we want to keep. Then we copy them, refactor them and put them in the "RegionOrebroLan.Web.Authentication.Decoration" namespace.
